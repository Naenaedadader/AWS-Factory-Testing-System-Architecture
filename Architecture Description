# System Architecture Overview

This document describes the high-level architecture of a cloud-based factory
testing system built using AWS serverless services. The system is designed to
support on-site data collection, centralized management, and operational
visibility while minimizing infrastructure overhead.

---

## Architectural Goals

The primary goals of the system architecture are:

- Enable tablet-friendly data entry for factory operators
- Centralize test and calibration records in a cloud-based system
- Support role-based access and management functions
- Provide aggregated metrics and dashboards for supervisors and administrators
- Minimize operational overhead through serverless design

---

## High-Level Architecture

The system follows a serverless, event-driven architecture composed of the
following layers:

1. Client Layer (Tablet / Browser)
2. Static Hosting Layer (Amazon S3)
3. API Layer (Amazon API Gateway)
4. Compute Layer (AWS Lambda)
5. Data Layer (Amazon RDS)

All client interactions are performed over HTTPS, and no direct access to the
database is allowed from the client.

---

## Client Layer

Factory operators and administrators access the system through a web-based
interface optimized for tablet devices. The client is responsible for:

- User authentication initiation
- Form navigation and data input
- Sending API requests with authentication tokens
- Rendering query results and dashboards

The client contains no business logic or database connectivity.

---

## Static Hosting Layer

The frontend application is hosted as static assets on Amazon S3. This approach
provides:

- Low operational cost
- High availability
- Simple deployment and versioning

All frontend resources are served securely over HTTPS.

---

## API Layer

Amazon API Gateway acts as the unified entry point for all client requests.
Responsibilities include:

- Request routing
- Basic request validation
- Forwarding requests to backend compute services

API Gateway isolates the client from backend implementation details.

---

## Compute Layer

AWS Lambda functions implement the core backend logic of the system, including:

- Authentication and token validation (JWT-based)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Business rule enforcement
- Data processing and persistence
- Query handling and result aggregation

Each function is designed to be stateless and independently scalable.

---

## Data Layer

Persistent data is stored in Amazon RDS using a relational database model.
The data layer is designed with the following principles:

- Standardized shared fields across records
- Consistent naming and data types
- Support for audit-related attributes (e.g., timestamps, status flags)
- Schema extensibility without impacting existing structures

The database is accessible only from the compute layer and is not exposed
directly to clients.

---

## Data and Reporting Capabilities

In addition to raw record storage, the system supports:

- Aggregation of test records
- Calculation of derived metrics (e.g., counts, rates, durations)
- Time-based trend analysis
- Summary dashboards for supervisory roles

All dashboard visualizations shown in this repository are based on example or
synthetic data.

---

## Security Considerations

Security is enforced across multiple layers:

- All communication uses HTTPS
- JWT-based authentication is required for API access
- Role-based authorization restricts available operations
- No direct database access from the client
- Sensitive logic is confined to AWS-managed services

---

## Scope and Limitations

This repository focuses on architectural design and system capabilities.
Detailed business workflows, domain-specific test forms, and implementation
details are intentionally excluded to maintain appropriate boundaries for
public sharing.

The architecture described here represents a generalized design pattern and
does not expose proprietary or production-specific configurations.
